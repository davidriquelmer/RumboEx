  "readme": "\nag-Grid\n==============\n\n#### Install with Bower\n```sh\n$ bower install ag-grid\n```\n\n#### Install with Npm\n```sh\n$ npm install angular-grid\n```\n\nSee the [www.angulargrid.com](http://www.angulargrid.com) for overview and documentation.\n\n\nBuilding\n==============\n\nTo build:\n- `npm install`\n- `npm install gulp -g`\n- `bower install`\n- `gulp` or `gulp release`\n\nNormal 'gulp' does not include minifiation or source maps, and starts a watch. This is for development.\n\n'gulp release' does minification and no source maps. This is for releasing.\n\nIf you are doing a Pull Request:\n- Make your code changes in `src/` files only, don't update dist files\n- Make your doc changes in `docs/`, a feature is not complete unless it's documented\n- Do manual end to end testing off all examples in documentation\n- Discard all changes to `dist/`\n- Create Pull Request\n\nAsking Questions\n==============\n\nPlease do not use GitHub issues to ask questions. Ask questions on the\n[website forum](http://www.angulargrid.com/forum).\n\n\nContributing\n==============\n\nI am not looking for contributors for this project. If you have ideas, feel free to\nget in touch and let me know. Or if you want to suggest something, feel free to\ncreate a pull request with your ideas.\n\nMy reason for not looking for contributors is that this grid is my hobby,\nsomething I work on in my spare time and enjoy. The design is something of a passion,\nand I'm bringing the grid into a particular direction. To take on contributors\nwould require overhead of organisation, as well as agreeing direction (both\ntechnical implementation and functional requirements).\n\nIf you would like to help, then please provide me with guidance and advice.\nI don't claim to know everything, so welcome others opinions on the direction\nof the project.\n",
